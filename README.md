# Embedded Mastery Roadmap
This repo tracks a structured **1-year learning journey** with weekly tasks to help you build solid foundations in both **ARM Cortex-M (microcontrollers)** and **ARM Cortex-A (application processors)** from bare-metal to Linux-level development.

---
## RPi Pico 2 W + Pico Debug Probe (ARM Cortex-M)
Master low-level embedded systems using the Raspberry Pi Pico and C SDK:
- GPIO, UART, PWM, ADC, DMA
- Interrupts, PIO, and FreeRTOS
- Bare-metal and real-time systems

> [Read the full Cortex-M roadmap](cortex-m/README.md)

---

## BeagleBone Black (ARM Cortex-A)
Build real-world skills for embedded Linux and BSP development on Cortex-A:
- ARMv7-A architecture and MMU
- U-Boot, TF-A, Linux kernel & drivers
- Yocto, secure boot, OTA, and real-time Linux
